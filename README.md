# VBA-Challenge
# VBA Homework: The VBA of Wall Street Instructions:

## Background
 In this homework assignment, I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

### Files Used

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabetical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.

## Instructions Followed: 

* Created a script that looped through all the stocks for one year each and created the output of the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

*I also inputted conditional formatting that highlighted positive change in green and negative change in red.

## BONUS work

*Solved solutions return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
